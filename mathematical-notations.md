# Mathematical Notations

This document provides a comprehensive overview of various mathematical notations used in different branches of mathematics.

## Numbers

- **Natural Numbers (ℕ)**: The set of positive integers starting from 1. Example: ℕ = {1, 2, 3, ...}
- **Whole Numbers (ℕ₀)**: The set of non-negative integers including zero. Example: ℕ₀ = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
- **Integers (ℤ)**: The set of all positive and negative whole numbers including zero. Example: ℤ = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
- **Rational Numbers (ℚ)**: The set of numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers. Example: ℚ = {p/q | p, q ∈ ℤ, q ≠ 0}
- **Real Numbers (ℝ)**: The set of all rational and irrational numbers. Example: ℝ = {x | x is a point on the number line}
- **Complex Numbers (ℂ)**: The set of numbers that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and $i$
  is the imaginary unit. Example: ℂ = {a + bi | a, b ∈ ℝ}
- Cardinal Numbers (|A|): A measure of the "number of elements" in a set A. Example: If A = {1, 2, 3}, then |A| = 3.

### Numbers Discussion

- |ℕ| = ∞ (The set of natural numbers is infinite)
- |ℤ| = ∞ (The set of integers is infinite)
- Is |ℚ| = |ℝ|? (No, the set of real numbers is uncountably infinite, while the set of rational numbers is countably infinite)
- Is |ℝ| = |ℂ|? (Yes, both sets have the same cardinality, which is uncountably infinite)

## Set Notations

- **Element of (∈)**: Indicates that an element belongs to a set. Example: x ∈ A means x is an element of set A.
- **Not an Element of (∉)**: Indicates that an element does not belong to a set. Example: x ∉ A means x is not an element of set A.
- **Subset (⊆)**: Indicates that all elements of one set are also elements of another set. Example: A ⊆ B means set A is a subset of set B.
- **Proper Subset (⊂)**: Indicates that all elements of one set are in another set, and the two sets are not equal.
  Example: A ⊂ B means set A is a proper subset of set B.
- **Union (∪)**: The set containing all elements from both sets. Example: A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}
- **Intersection (∩)**: The set containing only elements that are in both sets. Example: A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}
- **Set Difference (\\)**: The set containing elements that are in one set but not in another. Example: A \\ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∉ B}
- **Empty Set (∅)**: The set that contains no elements. Example: ∅ = {}
- Countable Set: A set that can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. Example: The set of integers ℤ is countable.
- Uncountable Set: A set that cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. Example: The set of real numbers ℝ is uncountable.

### Set Notations Examples

- A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3, 4, 5}
- A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- A ∩ B = {3}
- A \\ B = {1, 2}
- ∅ = {}
- A ⊆ B (if A = {1, 2} and B = {1, 2, 3})
- A ⊂ B (if A = {1, 2} and B = {1, 2, 3})
