# Axioms

Axioms are fundamental truths or principles that serve as the foundation for a
system of thought, logic, or mathematics. They are accepted without proof and
are used to derive further truths within a given framework.

## Characteristics of Axioms

1. **Self-Evident**: Axioms are often considered self-evident truths that do not require proof.
2. **Foundation**: They serve as the foundational building blocks for theories and systems.
3. **Universality**: Axioms are generally accepted within a specific context or field.
4. **Independence**: Axioms should be independent of one another, meaning that no axiom can be derived from the others.
5. **Consistency**: A set of axioms should not lead to contradictions within the system.

## Examples of Axioms

- **Mathematics**: In Euclidean geometry, one of the axioms is that through any two points, there is exactly one straight line.
- **Logic**: The law of non-contradiction states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.
- **Set Theory**: The axiom of choice states that given a collection of non-empty sets, it is possible to select one element from each set

## Axioms in Logic

### Law of Non-Contradiction

A statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.

1. "It is raining" cannot be both true and false simultaneously.
2. If "It is raining" is true, then "It is not raining" must be false.

Examples:

- If a number x is greater than 5, it cannot simultaneously be less than or equal to 5.
- If a light is on, it cannot simultaneously be off.
- If a number is even, it cannot simultaneously be odd.

Question: Can you provide an example of the law of non-contradiction in everyday life?

### Law of Excluded Middle

A statement is either true or false; there is no middle ground.

Examples:

- "It is raining" is either true or false; there is no third option.
- A light switch is either on or off; there is no in-between state.
- A door is either open or closed; it cannot be partially open.

Question: Can you provide an example of the law of excluded middle in decision making?

### Modus Ponens

If A holds true, and A implies B, then B must also hold true.

Example:
1. If it is raining (A), then the ground is wet (B).
2. It is raining (A).
3. Therefore, the ground is wet (B).
