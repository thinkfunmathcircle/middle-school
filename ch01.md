## Ice Breaker Problems

### Problem 1: Bacteria Growth

A jar is filled with bacteria. Every minute, the number of bacteria in the jar
doubles. If the jar get full in 1 minute, how long would it take for the jar to
be half full?

#### Discussion Bacteria Growth

Since the number of bacteria doubles every minute, if the jar is full at 1
minute, it must have been half full at 30 seconds (or 0.5 minutes). Therefore,
it would take 0.5 minutes for the jar to be half full. Is that correct?

Since the bacteria double every minute, if the jar is full at 1 minute, it must
have been half full at 59 seconds. Bacteria growth is exponential.

#### Concept: Linear growth vs Exponential growth

Liner Growth: y = mx + b
Exponential Growth: y = a * b^x
Plot both types of growth to see the difference.

.. math::

   \text{Linear Growth: } y = 2x
   \text{Exponential Growth: } y = 2^x

### Problem 2: Frog Jumping

A frog is at the bottom of a 10-foot well. Every day, the frog jumps up 3 feet
but at night, it slips down 2 feet. How many days will it take for the frog to
get out of the well?

#### Discussion Frog Jumping

Each day, the frog makes a net gain of 1 foot (3 feet up - 2 feet down). After
7 days, the frog will have climbed 7 feet. On the 8th day, the frog jumps up
3 feet from 7 feet, reaching the top of the well (10 feet) and escapes
without slipping back down. Therefore, it will take the frog 8 days to get out
of the well.

#### Concept: Net Gain

Net Gain = Gain - Loss
